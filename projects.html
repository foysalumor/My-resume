                        <p>It’s a AI based web API, which able to find similar text data from a large
                            number of records or text data collection. We used unsupervised learning
                            technique to develop our AI model, also clustered data set to get searching
                            efficiency. We also developed some demo websites bases on our API, which
                            fetch data also able to show relevant data easily by using our API. In this
                            project I learn data clustering, similar data searching, Including AI on
                            Django application, also team work, analytical ability as soft skills</p>

                        <p>This project is about establishing a D to C business for farmers, which beaks 
                            the monopoly of the middleman. Farmers will be able to sell their products 
                            direct to consumers. This web app is developed on the Django framework. In 
                            this project, I learned CRUD operation on Django also Django model with an 
                            image field, Django form also team work, analytical ability as soft skills</p>

                            get your partners, then it will help to communicate with those interested people. 
                            It has a common file and image sharing system which will help make it easy to
                            share event’s images. This web application’s front-end uses HTML,CSS and 
                            the backend language is Django (Python) and the database is SqLite.</p>

                            could have diabetes or not based on some other health data. In this project I
                            learn about train and test splitting the dataset, develop an AI model and result
